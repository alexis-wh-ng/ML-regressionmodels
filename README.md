Assignment 1

Part 1:
Several regression models have been compared to illustrate the trade-off between overfitting and underfitting.

Part 2:
Linear regression, basis expansion, and feature selection have been experimented using the Boston Housing data set. The approach used for feature selection is the greedy algorithm where it starts from an empty set and grows gradually by selecting at each step the feature that increases the performance of the predictor the most. In this assignment, least squares regression is used and K-fold cross-validation error is computed to measure performance.
